python

my_list = [2, 24, 12, 354, 233]
Initializes a list named my_list with values [2, 24, 12, 354, 233].
python

for i in range(len(my_list) - 1):
Begins a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of my_list minus 1.
The loop variable i represents the index of the current iteration.
python

    minimum = i
Sets the variable minimum to the value of i.
This variable will keep track of the index of the minimum value found so far.
python

    for j in range(i + 1, len(my_list)):
Begins a nested loop that iterates from i + 1 to the length of my_list.
The loop variable j represents the index of the inner loop.
python

        if my_list[j] < my_list[minimum]:
Checks if the value at index j in my_list is less than the value at index minimum.
If it is, the condition is satisfied, and the following block will execute.
python

            minimum = j
Sets the value of minimum to j, indicating that a new minimum value has been found.
python

            if minimum != i:
                my_list[i], my_list[minimum] = my_list[minimum], my_list[i]
Swaps the values at indices i and minimum in my_list.
This ensures that the minimum value is placed at its correct sorted position.
python

print(my_list)
Prints the final sorted my_list after the loops have completed.
Now let's summarize the changes and the final output:

Initial my_list value: [2, 24, 12, 354, 233]

Iteration 1:

i = 0, minimum = 0
Inner loop compares my_list[1] with my_list[0] and finds it greater.
No swap is performed.
Iteration 2:

i = 1, minimum = 1
Inner loop compares my_list[2] with my_list[1] and finds it smaller.
The values at indices 1 and 2 are swapped: my_list[1], my_list[2] = 12, 24
Iteration 3:

i = 2, minimum = 2
Inner loop compares my_list[3] with my_list[2] and finds it greater.
No swap is performed.
Iteration 4:

i = 3, minimum = 3
Inner loop compares my_list[4] with my_list[3] and finds it greater.
No swap is performed.
Final my_list value: [2, 12, 24, 233, 354]

The purpose of this program is to sort the list my_list in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm. The inner loop finds the minimum value in the remaining unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the current element in the outer loop. The process continues until the entire list is sorted. The sorted list is then printed as the final output.
