The purpose of this code is to implement the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort a list (alist) in ascending order. The code defines a function called insertion_sort that takes a list as input. It then iterates over the elements of the list, starting from the second element (index = 1).

Within each iteration, the current value is stored in the variable currentvalue, and the variable position is set to the current index. The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as position is greater than 0 and the element at alist[position-1] is greater than currentvalue. This while loop shifts the elements to the right until the correct position for currentvalue is found.

Once the correct position is determined, the value of currentvalue is placed at that position in the list. This process continues until all elements in the list have been sorted.

After defining the insertion_sort function, the code creates a list alist with some unsorted integers. It then calls the insertion_sort function, passing alist as the argument, which sorts the list in place. Finally, the sorted list is printed using print(alist).
