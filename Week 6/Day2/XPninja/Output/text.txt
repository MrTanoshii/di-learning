3 <= 3 < 9
Output: True
Explanation: This expression evaluates the chained comparison. It checks if 3 is less than or equal to 3 and if 3 is less than 9. Both comparisons are true, so the overall result is True.

3 == 3 == 3
Output: True
Explanation: This expression compares whether 3 is equal to 3 and if 3 is equal to 3. Both comparisons are true, so the overall result is True.

bool(0)
Output: False
Explanation: The bool() function converts the given value to a boolean. In this case, 0 is considered as False.

bool(5 == "5")
Output: False
Explanation: The expression 5 == "5" compares whether the value 5 is equal to the string "5". Since they have different types, the comparison evaluates to False. The bool() function converts False to False.

bool(4 == 4) == bool("4" == "4")
Output: True
Explanation: This expression compares the boolean values returned by two separate comparisons: 4 == 4 and "4" == "4". Both comparisons are true, so both bool() functions return True. Finally, the equality comparison between the two True values results in True.

bool(bool(None))
Output: False
Explanation: The expression bool(None) converts None to False, and then the outer bool() function converts False to False.

x = (1 == True)
y = (1 == False)
a = True + 4
b = False + 10
