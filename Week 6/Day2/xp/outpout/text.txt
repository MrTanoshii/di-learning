5 < 3
The expression 5 < 3 compares whether 5 is less than 3. Since this is not true, the output will be False.

3 == 3
The expression 3 == 3 compares whether 3 is equal to 3. This is true, so the output will be True.

3 == "3"
The expression 3 == "3" compares whether the number 3 is equal to the string "3". Since they are not of the same type, the output will be False.

"3" > 3
The expression "3" > 3 compares whether the string "3" is greater than the number 3. In Python, string comparison is based on lexicographical order. Since "3" comes after 3 in lexicographical order, the output will be True.

"Hello" == "hello"
The expression "Hello" == "hello" compares whether the string "Hello" is equal to the string "hello". Since the two strings have different casing (upper case vs. lower case), the output will be False.

So, the predicted output for each code snippet is as follows:

False
True
False
True
False
